# Express Movies App 

In this project I've implemented a short, simple to use and really light application, which can search a movies by title or actor's name.

For fetch data I've used IMDB API with public key.

App is live on: https://express-movies-app-08ae04a1ed27.herokuapp.com/

Enjoy!


## Used technologies 

During development process, I've used several web-technologies:
- `JavaScript` as well as the main programming language for Web-development;
- `Node.js` to develop a back-end application that can use a IMDB API;
- `Express.js`, `Express Router`, `Helmet` and `Morgan`; 
- `ESLint`, `Prettier`, `Husky` for best code-style;
- `ejs (Embedded JavaScript)` for quick generating an HTML-content onto web-pages. 

## Description 

This application can be used on the way to fast searching some new movies to watch. 

You can choose params of a future search between "Movie Title" and "Actor".

Also, you can click on a poster of movie, and application will instantly open it's page with short description.

To visit movie web-site, click a poster image again.


## Instructions

If you want to open an app on your PC locally, just type: 
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

Also, you can use a deployed application. Generally, there is no need to run app locally.
